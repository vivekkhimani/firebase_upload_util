### Introduction:
This app was specifically built for a campaign which is going to be hosted by Ash Initiative (www.ashinitiative.com). More details about the mission and vision of the organization can be found on their website. The main purpose of this app was to allow the campaing participants to upload their daily content and organize it in a database. In addition to allowing the users to upload the content, the app provides passwordless authentication, because of which, only the registered participants
can access the upload interface using verified email.

### Highlights:
- Scalable for a huge traffic trying to upload at the same time.
- Passwordless authentication to avoid scam uploads.
- Decent security to block the users from skipping the authentication step.
- More updates scheduled for future versions.
